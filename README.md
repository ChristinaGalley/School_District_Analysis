## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to generate a district and school summary from which high and low performing schools, math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type may be compared. After the initial analysis, alterations in the Thomas High School 9th grade math and reading scores were found which indicated academic dishonesty. A second analysis was performed after removing the math and reaidng scores associated with the Thomas High School 9th graders.

## Summary
In conclusion, it seems the update to replace the reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School with NaN significantly affected the Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools by showing approximatley 26% decrease in % pasisng math, % passing reading, and % overall passing. This resulted in Thomas High School dropping from the top five schools list. Scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type were minimally affected by the update (<= 8.0% decrease between original and updated). The math and reading scores by grade where not affected at all with the execption that all the 9th grade math and reading scores were marked as NaN.
